The registration, login, and logout functionalities are in place.
Though, if you go to the login url while you are already logged in, it says
{
    "detail": "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing."
}
unless you add a header called X-Csrftoken with the value: csrftoken's value from the cookies.
I need to automate it, of course. Or maybe when the frontend calls that endpoint, they (I, in this case) will take care of it.
Update: Confirmed that the frontend will take care of it.

But now, lets work on books.
A user should be able to add books.
They should't be able to add genre.
But they should be able to get all genre.

How do i want to let users add genres in their books?
im thinking- a comma separated string of genre ids.
1. Let them do it while putting it up. So just a new field called genres.
2. Let them do it later. New api for this, pass the {book_id: x, genres: "1,2,3"} in this fashion.
to delete genres, just put a (-) sign in front of it - 
like -  genres: "1,2,-4" means you want to add 1 and 2 to the book and remove -4 from the book.

Now, a user should be able to get books by genre
Just add genre_id in the body of the /books/books request.
If not added, it will show all books, and if added it will show books of that genre.

When you come across a book you wanna rent, you would want to contact the user - for that, I added a contact field in the app_user model which is an extension of django's user model (which is sick by the way)
